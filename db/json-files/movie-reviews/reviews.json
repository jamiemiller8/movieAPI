        "summary_short": "Ashton Kutcher, the shaggy haired young actor best known for &quot;Dude, Where's My Car?&quot; and dating Demi Moore, stars in a purported thriller that mines the memory loss theme that has been turning up with striking regularity in American movies, from &quot;Memento&quot; to &quot;Paycheck.&quot;  Mr. Kutcher's character, Evan Treborn, is an earnest college student whose life has been marked by a series of blackouts surrounding traumatic events.  Majoring in psychology (he keeps a rat maze in his dorm room), he hopes to discover the reason behind the mysterious black holes in his mind. For reasons the film does not trouble to explain, Evan discovers that, if he reads a few lines from his childhood journals, he will be projected back in time to his traumatic moments, where he will be able to change his behavior in small ways that will make a big difference later on.  The overly complicated plotting quickly becomes impossible to follow, while the filmmakers — the writer-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber — wallow in some of the most repugnant imagery imaginable: a dog set aflame, a baby blown to bits. — Dave Kehr",

        "summary_short": "To describe &quot;The Butterfly,&quot; a delicate, visually translucent film, as the heartwarming story of a friendship between a grumpy old man and an eight-year-old girl might suggest that this tender wisp of a movie is the latest icky tearjerker in which a sweet little angel melts the frozen heart of a bitter curmudgeon. But if the movie partakes of that formula, its combination of psychological insight and emotional restraint help it to transcend sentimentality. Michel Serrault plays a cranky entomologist who takes the neglected eight-year-old girl who lives upstairs on a field trip to the mountains in search of a rare Isabella butterfly. The gorgeous, pastoral cinematography captures the wonder of nature with an intoxicating sensuousness. — Stephen Holden",
