# Project 2 Movie API

This API project displays a list of movies, including their title, year, genres, etc. The data for this project was retrieved from two databases. The first one is the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/#top). The Open Movie Database (OMDb) API is "a RESTful webservice to obtain movie information." The second database is [The New York Times Developer Network](https://developer.nytimes.com/). The NYT Developer API stores a list of several API's, including a movie review API, which is the one I used for this project.
